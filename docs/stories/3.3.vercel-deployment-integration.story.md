## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 3.1 (Website Template Design) and 3.2 (AI-Powered Content Generation) established:
- Responsive HTML/CSS template foundation with mobile-first approach
- AI-generated business-specific content for personalization
- Template system architecture and file structure
- Content generation and validation capabilities
- Performance optimization and accessibility requirements

### Data Models
- **DeploymentResult Schema**: Deployment URL, deployment status, project ID, domain configuration, SSL status, deployment timestamp, run_id, business_id
- **VercelProject Model**: Project configuration, environment variables, build settings, deployment settings, custom domains
- **DeploymentStatus Model**: Current status, deployment progress, error messages, rollback information, monitoring data
- **DomainConfiguration Model**: Custom domain settings, SSL certificate status, DNS configuration, subdomain generation
- **DeploymentHistory Model**: Version history, rollback points, deployment metadata, performance metrics

### API Specifications
- **Endpoint**: POST /api/v1/deployment/vercel
- **Request**: JSON with business_id, template_data, content_data, and optional deployment parameters
- **Response**: JSON with deployment result, deployment URL, status, and configuration details
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth token required
- **Rate Limiting**: Integrated with existing rate limiting service for "deployment" API

### Component Specifications
- **VercelDeploymentService**: Backend service class extending BaseService pattern
- **Vercel Deployment API**: FastAPI endpoint with proper error handling and validation
- **Vercel API Integration**: REST API integration for deployment operations
- **Build Process**: Static site generation and optimization for Vercel deployment
- **Monitoring System**: Deployment status tracking and error handling

### File Locations
- **Service**: `backend/src/services/vercel_deployment_service.py`
- **API Endpoint**: `backend/src/api/v1/deployment.py`
- **Schemas**: `backend/src/schemas/deployment.py`
- **Models**: `backend/src/models/deployment.py`
- **Tests**: `backend/tests/unit/test_services/test_vercel_deployment_service.py` and API tests

### Testing Requirements
- **Test Location**: `backend/tests/unit/test_services/` and API tests
- **Test Framework**: pytest with httpx for API testing
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests for service methods, API endpoint testing, Vercel integration testing
- **Mocking**: Vercel API calls must be mocked for reliable testing

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance**: Deployment must complete within 5 minutes for user experience
- **Rate Limiting**: Must integrate with existing rate limiting service
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when Vercel deployment fails
- **Logging**: Structured logging with runId, businessId, and serviceName
- **Database**: Use existing repository pattern for data persistence

### Vercel Integration Requirements
- **API Authentication**: Vercel API token and project configuration
- **Build Process**: Static site generation compatible with Vercel
- **Domain Management**: Custom domain and subdomain configuration
- **SSL Provisioning**: Automatic SSL certificate management
- **Monitoring**: Deployment status tracking and error reporting

### Project Structure Alignment
- Follows existing backend service pattern with BaseService inheritance
- Integrates with existing API structure under `/api/v1/` namespace
- Uses established schema and model patterns for data consistency
- Follows testing strategy with unit tests in appropriate directories
- Integrates with Epic 3 template and content generation for complete demo site workflow

## Testing
- **Test File Location**: `backend/tests/unit/test_services/test_vercel_deployment_service.py` and API tests
- **Test Standards**: pytest framework with async support, comprehensive Vercel integration testing
- **Testing Frameworks**: pytest, httpx for API testing, pytest-asyncio for async support
- **Specific Requirements**: Test deployment workflow, Vercel API integration, error handling, and API endpoint validation
