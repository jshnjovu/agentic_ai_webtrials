# Story 1.4: Data Merging and Deduplication

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** lead generation agent,
**I want** to merge business data from multiple sources
**so that** I have complete, validated business profiles

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✓ Business matching algorithm using name + address similarity
2. ✓ Contact information prioritization (prefer most complete data)
3. ✓ Duplicate business detection and removal
4. ✓ Data confidence scoring for merged records
5. ✓ Manual review flagging for uncertain matches

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Business Matching Algorithm Implementation (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create fuzzy string matching for business names
  - [ ] Implement address similarity scoring using coordinate proximity
  - [ ] Develop combined scoring algorithm (name + address weights)
- [ ] Task 2: Data Merging and Prioritization (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Implement contact information prioritization logic
  - [ ] Create data completeness scoring for each source
  - [ ] Develop merge strategy for conflicting information
- [ ] Task 3: Duplicate Detection and Removal (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create duplicate detection service using business fingerprints
  - [ ] Implement automatic duplicate removal for high-confidence matches
  - [ ] Add duplicate flagging for manual review scenarios
- [ ] Task 4: Confidence Scoring System (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Implement data confidence scoring algorithm
  - [ ] Create confidence level assignment (high/medium/low)
  - [ ] Add confidence indicators to merged business records
- [ ] Task 5: Manual Review System (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create flagging system for uncertain matches
  - [ ] Implement manual review workflow for flagged records
  - [ ] Add review status tracking and resolution

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Google Places search implementation from Story 1.2
- Yelp Fusion search implementation from Story 1.3
- API authentication and rate limiting from Story 1.1
- Both data sources provide business information that needs to be merged

### Data Models
- **Business Matching Model**: Name similarity, address proximity, combined confidence scores
- **Merged Business Model**: Combined data from both sources with confidence indicators
- **Duplicate Detection Model**: Business fingerprints and similarity thresholds
- **Review Flag Model**: Uncertain matches flagged for manual review
[Source: architecture/data-models.md - No specific guidance found in architecture docs]

### API Specifications
- **Business Matching API**: Internal service for comparing business records
- **Data Merging API**: Service for combining and prioritizing information
- **Duplicate Detection API**: Service for identifying and flagging duplicates
- **Review Management API**: Endpoints for managing manual review workflow
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md - No specific guidance found in architecture docs]

### Component Specifications
- **Matching Service**: Python service class extending BaseService pattern
- **Data Merger Service**: Service for combining business information from multiple sources
- **Duplicate Detector**: Service for identifying duplicate business records
- **Confidence Scorer**: Service for calculating data confidence levels
- **Review Manager**: Service for managing manual review workflow
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#external-api-integration]

### File Locations
- **API Routes**: `apps/api/src/api/v1/business-management/` for matching and merging endpoints
- **Services**: `apps/api/src/services/` for matching, merging, and duplicate detection services
- **Models**: `apps/api/src/schemas/` for business matching and merging models
- **Repository**: `apps/api/src/repositories/business_repository.py` for data persistence
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#api]

### Testing Requirements
- **Test Location**: `apps/api/tests/unit/test_services/test_business_matching_service.py`
- **Test Framework**: pytest + httpx for API testing
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests for matching algorithms, merging logic, and duplicate detection
- **Test Data**: Mock business data from both Google Places and Yelp Fusion for testing scenarios
- **Edge Cases**: Test various data quality scenarios and edge cases
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]

### Technical Constraints
- **Python Version**: 3.11+ for backend implementation
- **FastAPI Framework**: 0.104+ for API endpoints
- **Database Access**: Always use repository pattern - never write raw SQL queries in business logic
- **Error Handling**: All API routes must use standard error handler with proper HTTP status codes
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with consistent format including runId, businessId, and agentName
- **Performance**: Implement efficient algorithms for large dataset processing

## Testing
- **Test File Location**: `apps/api/tests/unit/test_services/test_business_matching_service.py`
- **Test Standards**: Follow pytest patterns with comprehensive test coverage for matching algorithms
- **Testing Frameworks**: pytest + httpx for backend testing
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Test business name matching with various similarity scenarios
  - Test address proximity calculations and coordinate-based matching
  - Test data merging logic with conflicting information from different sources
  - Test duplicate detection with various business fingerprint scenarios
  - Test confidence scoring algorithms and threshold assignments
  - Test manual review flagging system and workflow
  - Test performance with large datasets and edge cases
