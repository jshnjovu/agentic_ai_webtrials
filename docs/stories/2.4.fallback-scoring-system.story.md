## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 2.1 (Lighthouse API Integration), 2.2 (Custom Heuristic Evaluation), and 2.3 (Score Validation and Confidence) established:
- WebsiteScore schema and database models for both scoring methods
- BaseService pattern for service implementation
- Rate limiting integration for scoring APIs
- Comprehensive testing framework with pytest
- Data models for storing individual scoring results and validation data
- Heuristic evaluation capabilities for fallback scenarios

### Data Models
- **FallbackScore Schema**: Heuristic-only overall score (0-100), trust score (0-100), CRO score (0-100), mobile score (0-100), content score (0-100), social score (0-100), confidence level (reduced), fallback reason, fallback timestamp
- **FallbackReason Model**: Failure type, error message, severity level, fallback decision, retry attempts, success status
- **FallbackMetrics Model**: Fallback success rate, average fallback score quality, failure pattern analysis, performance metrics
- **FallbackHistory Model**: Historical fallback data for trend analysis and improvement tracking
- **FallbackQuality Model**: Quality assessment metrics for heuristic-only results, reliability indicators

### API Specifications
- **Endpoint**: POST /api/v1/website-scoring/fallback
- **Request**: JSON with business_id, website_url, lighthouse_failure_reason, and optional fallback parameters
- **Response**: JSON with fallback scores, confidence level, fallback reason, and quality indicators
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth token required (same as previous stories)
- **Rate Limiting**: Integrated with existing rate limiting service for "fallback" API

### Component Specifications
- **FallbackScoringService**: Backend service class extending BaseService pattern from previous stories
- **Fallback Scoring API**: FastAPI endpoint with proper error handling and validation
- **Fallback Detection**: Intelligent failure pattern recognition and decision logic
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with configurable retry limits
- **Quality Assessment**: Metrics for evaluating fallback result reliability

### File Locations
- **Service**: `backend/src/services/fallback_scoring_service.py`
- **API Endpoint**: `backend/src/api/v1/website_scoring.py` (extend existing file)
- **Schemas**: `backend/src/schemas/website_scoring.py` (extend existing file)
- **Models**: `backend/src/models/website_scoring.py` (extend existing file)
- **Tests**: `backend/tests/unit/test_services/test_fallback_scoring_service.py` and extend existing API tests

### Testing Requirements
- **Test Location**: `backend/tests/unit/test_services/` and extend existing API tests
- **Test Framework**: pytest with httpx for API testing (same as previous stories)
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests for service methods, API endpoint testing, fallback scenario testing
- **Mocking**: Lighthouse failures must be mocked for reliable testing, fallback logic validated

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance**: Fallback detection and scoring must complete within 10 seconds
- **Rate Limiting**: Must integrate with existing rate limiting service
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when both Lighthouse and fallback fail
- **Logging**: Structured logging with runId, businessId, serviceName, and fallback reasons
- **Database**: Use existing repository pattern for data persistence

### Fallback Strategy Requirements
- **Automatic Detection**: Identify Lighthouse failures without manual intervention
- **Intelligent Decision**: Choose fallback based on failure severity and type
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure fallback results meet minimum quality standards
- **Retry Logic**: Attempt Lighthouse recovery before committing to fallback
- **Monitoring**: Track fallback usage patterns and success rates

### Project Structure Alignment
- Follows existing backend service pattern with BaseService inheritance (same as previous stories)
- Integrates with existing API structure under `/api/v1/website-scoring/` namespace
- Uses established schema and model patterns for data consistency
- Follows testing strategy with unit tests in appropriate directories
- Extends existing website scoring system for comprehensive fallback coverage

## Testing
- **Test File Location**: `backend/tests/unit/test_services/test_fallback_scoring_service.py` and extend existing API tests
- **Test Standards**: pytest framework with async support, comprehensive fallback scenario testing
- **Testing Frameworks**: pytest, httpx for API testing, pytest-asyncio for async support
- **Specific Requirements**: Test fallback detection accuracy, retry logic, quality assessment, and API endpoint validation
