# 1. Goals and Background Context

## Business Goals

**Primary Objective:** Create an autonomous AI agent that discovers local businesses using dual-source validation, evaluates their websites with hybrid Lighthouse + heuristics scoring, generates improved demo sites, and produces personalized outreach campaigns to convert prospects into web design clients.

**Strategic Goals:**
- Demonstrate viability of AI-powered lead generation system for web design/digital marketing agencies
- Automate prospect discovery and qualification with 95%+ reliability
- Provide tangible value demonstrations (demo websites) with hybrid scoring validation
- Scale outreach efforts with personalized messaging across multiple channels
- Maintain operational flexibility with local CSV + optional cloud Google Sheets export

## Product Vision

An intelligent agent that transforms lead generation for web design agencies by combining:
- **Hybrid Discovery**: Dual-source business identification (Google Places + Yelp Fusion)
- **Intelligent Scoring**: Complementary evaluation (Lighthouse API + Custom Heuristics)
- **Automated Generation**: AI-powered demo website creation for low-scoring businesses
- **Personalized Outreach**: Multi-channel campaign generation (Email, WhatsApp, SMS)
- **Flexible Export**: Local CSV + optional cloud sync for maximum workflow adaptability

## Background Context

This trial validates the concept for a larger automated lead generation platform targeting local service businesses with poor web presence. The hybrid architecture approach eliminates single points of failure while ensuring data quality and system reliability in real-world conditions.

**Target Market:** Local service businesses (restaurants, healthcare, beauty, legal, real estate, automotive, home services) with websites scoring <70 on comprehensive evaluation criteria.

## Success Metrics

**Technical Performance:**
- Process 10 businesses end-to-end with <15 minutes cycle time
- Achieve 95%+ success rate through hybrid systems design
- Generate websites scoring >70 on evaluation criteria
- Maintain 85% average contact field completion rate

**Business Impact:**
- Demonstrate complete workflow in â‰¤5 minutes
- Produce 3 tailored outreach messages per prospect
- Create hosted demo sites for qualifying businesses
- Export comprehensive data with 20+ fields per business
