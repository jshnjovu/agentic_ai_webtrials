# Agentic AI Trial Task â€“ LeadGen Website Makeover Agent

## Overview
This project scaffold is for the trial task: Build an Agentic AI system that:
1. Asks for location
2. Asks for local niche
3. Discovers businesses in that niche & location and collects contact details
4. Scores each business's website against best web design practices
5. Generates a new website for low scoring sites
6. Hosts the generated website temporarily and returns a link
7. Saves all data to a sheet/CSV
8. Generates WhatsApp, Email, and SMS messages pitching the new website

**Note:** This scaffold includes backend (FastAPI) and frontend (Next.js) placeholders, plus utility scripts for CSV writing. Replace stubs with your working implementations.
