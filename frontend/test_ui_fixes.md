# UI Fixes Test Guide

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate "Discovered Businesses" Tables
**Problem**: Business table was showing twice due to rendering in message loop
**Solution**: Moved table to single location below messages area

### 2. Confirmation Notification Delay
**Problem**: Confirmation notifications came late after user already confirmed
**Solution**: Added immediate workflow progress updates and better state management

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test 1: No Duplicate Tables
1. **Start Discovery**: Type "Find vegan restaurants in Austin, TX" in chat
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch for business discovery progress
3. **Check Table**: Verify only ONE business table appears
4. **Expected Result**: Single table below messages, no duplicates

### Test 2: Faster Confirmation Handling
1. **Trigger Confirmation**: Start a workflow that requires confirmation
2. **Confirm Action**: Click "Yes, Confirm" button
3. **Check Response**: Verify confirmation clears immediately
4. **Expected Result**: Confirmation area disappears instantly, workflow progresses

### Test 3: Improved Visual Feedback
1. **Discovery Status**: Look for green status indicator when discovery completes
2. **Confirmation Buttons**: Verify buttons are larger and more prominent
3. **Loading States**: Check for proper loading indicators during discovery
